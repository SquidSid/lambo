# How to

A minimal `(10min)` guide on how to get the things setup,  
so you can have your lambo.


## 1. You need a SOLANA compatible wallet

Phantom and Sollet Wallet are popular choices.  
We personally use **Phantom**:  

  1.1 Download the Phantom Wallet Chrome Extension from https://phantom.app/

  1.2 Create a wallet (save your password and passphrase!)

  1.3 Use the chrome extension manager (the puzzle-piece icon) to pin Phantom to your extension toolbar

  1.4 Open the Phantom window, and click the letters on top of the window (this is your Phantom wallet address)
  
  ## 2. Fund your new Solana  wallet with "SOL" crypto

You can send SOL to your wallet from Binance or Kraken (or likely, most crypto accounts - if you have one), but if you don't - you can fund your wallet from your credit card via FTX.com.  

Its a bit involved - but follow our steps (or a similar walkthrough from https://official.catodex.com/solana-trade-guide/transfer-funds-from-ftx-or-binance ) and you will get there:

Open https://FTX.com and  
  
  2.1 Create a new Account (email, password...)

  2.2 Verify your account (photo of passport, face-photo...)

  2.3 Enable two factor authentication (Settings > Enable 2FA)

  2.4 Deposit an amount from your credit card (e.g. $100 USD)

  2.5 Search for Solana (top center search field, choose SOL/USD)

  2.5 Choose **Withdraw**, enter your Phantom wallet address (from step `1.4` above) as the recipient
  
  2.6 Approve with 2FA

## Almost there!

Wait a couple of minutes, and the funds you "withdrew" from your FTX account should appear in your Phantom wallet. 


## To the moon!

Open https://pixelambo.com/

  4.1 Click 'Connect wallet', choose Phantom

  4.2 Login with your Phantom password

  4.3 Click 'Mint one lambo' (on the website)

  4.3 Approve the transaction

Wait a few seconds, and an awesome Lambo should arrive in your wallet!  
(Click the four squares in the Phantom wallet to see it.)
